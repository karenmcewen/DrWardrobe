BOOTSTRAP
*tried to use three different bootswatch templates, kept getting errors for EVERY line that : were missing, so I deleted them
?is there a limit to how many bootswatch templates you are allowed to use?
*after doing so and resetting my bundleconfig.cs, 
	in bootstrap.css I began getting an error that lines 2016 and 5165 were not known property names
	I checked them and they looked like all the similar lines, so eventually I just commented them out 
	to make the green lines go away. will probably have to fix this later

IMAGES
*all images are subject to copyright, mostly from the BBC.  Since this isn't going out on a live site, I didn't worry about it.
*I have started editing all images to be the same width of 400px before adding them to the images folder
(not all images were edited thusly)

DATABASE
*the data exists when I open in Google, even after shutting down the program
however, it is not showing up in my SSMS database.
It could be because they have different names?
perhaps I missed a connection when i was building the script?
I went to the EDMX file and updated the tables from the database (do I need to do the opposite?)
I had to restart this project several times...

Still to do:
-index and details pages for color, occasion, season
-make sure the database is being sent to git!
-double check URLs, some are still blanks
-check responsive layout on ALL pages
-ask about URLs-I copied the actual URL, sheet said to use ~/content/url (but gabrielle said that didn't work)

why do I keep getting this error when I do git add . (it doesn't seem to affect anything):
warning: LF will be replaced by CRLF in DrWardrobe/Content/bootstrap.css.
The file will have its original line endings in your working directory.
