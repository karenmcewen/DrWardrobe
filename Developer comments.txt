BOOTSTRAP
*tried to use three different bootswatch templates, kept getting errors for EVERY line that : were missing, so I deleted them
?is there a limit to how many bootswatch templates you are allowed to use?
*after doing so and resetting my bundleconfig.cs, 
	in bootstrap.css I began getting an error that lines 2016 and 5165 were not known property names
	I checked them and they looked like all the similar lines, so eventually I just commented them out 
	to make the green lines go away. will probably have to fix this later

IMAGES
*all images are subject to copyright, mostly from the BBC.  Since this isn't going out on a live site, I didn't worry about it.
*I have started editing all images to be the same width of 400px before adding them to the images folder

DATABASE
*the data exists when I open in Google, even after shutting down the program
however, it is not showing up in my SSMS database.
It could be because they have different names?
perhaps I missed a connection when i was building the script?
I went to the EDMX file and updated the tables from the database (do I need to do the opposite?)
I had to restart this project several times...

Still to do:
-change the heading names for all of the tables (yes, some still have tables, but I added pics!)
-add background picture to the navbar on all pages
-change background color on all pages
-change font color for "create new" option on most pages
